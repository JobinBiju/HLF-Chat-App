# Hyperledger Fabric powered Chat Application
This is the final year B.Tech project of [Navaneeth Krishna](https://github.com/navaneeth-krishna), [Jobin Biju](https://github.com/JobinBiju), [Jeffin Gijo](https://github.com/jfngc293), [Alan Thomas Shaji](https://github.com/shaji-stark).

The Chat Application is built using Flutter as it's frontend and NodeJS as it's backend. The media files shared within the chat application is always monitored and kept track in the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network. So as in a hypothetical scenario of one of the media files being circulated was fake, misleading, revengeful can be ultimately traced back to it's origin/sender and also it's forwarding users.
This project aims to bring responsibility and accountability back to the anonymous internet.

#### Folder Structure
- HLF Chat folder - all files regarding the Flutter frontend
- Node - files regarding the [socket server](https://msg-socket-server.herokuapp.com/) powered by NodeJS.
- REST-API - files containing the [REST-API](https://msg-restapi.herokuapp.com/) routes to invoke the HLF Client.
- Fabric Network - files required for building the hyperledger network and creating channels and smart contracts (Chaincodes).

#### Further info about how to run the project will be uploaded soon.
